# Housing Price Predictor with Deployment

This project aims to predict housing prices in Baku, Azerbaijan, using machine learning models. It provides a user-friendly web application for users to estimate property prices based on features such as area, number of rooms, bill of sale availability, repair status, and location.

## Overview

The housing market dataset was collected over a one-year period, focusing on properties in Baku. The dataset was used to train machine learning models to predict prices for two categories:

- **New Buildings**
- **Old Buildings**

The prediction is based on features such as:
- Area (in square meters)
- Number of rooms
- Bill of sale availability (Yes/No)
- Repair status (Yes/No)
- Current floor
- Maximum floors in the building
- Geolocation (latitude and longitude)

The project includes the following components:
1. Data preprocessing and model training.
2. Deployment of the prediction system using Streamlit.
3. Interactive map integration for location selection.

## Features

### **1. Interactive Web Application**
- Users can input property details like area, number of rooms, and repair status.
- A dynamic map allows users to select the propertyâ€™s location by clicking on the map.

### **2. Machine Learning Models**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for predicting prices of new buildings.
- **Random Forest (RF)** for predicting prices of old buildings.

### **3. Real-Time Predictions**
- The app instantly predicts the property price based on the provided inputs.

## Usage

### **Input Features**
- **Category**: Select either "New Building" or "Old Building."
- **Area**: Enter the area in square meters (min: 35, max: 1500).
- **Rooms**: Specify the number of rooms (min: 1, max: 15).
- **Bill of Sale**: Indicate whether the property has a bill (Yes/No).
- **Repair Status**: Indicate whether the property is repaired (Yes/No).
- **Current Floor**: Specify the current floor (min: 1).
- **Max Floor**: Specify the maximum number of floors (min: 1).

### **Interactive Map**
Click on the map to select the latitude and longitude of the property.

### **Prediction**
Click the "Predict" button to estimate the property price. The predicted price will be displayed below the button.

## Future Enhancements

1. Adding more features like neighborhood rating, proximity to amenities, etc.
2. Expanding the dataset to include properties outside Baku.
3. Improving the user interface for better usability.
4. Incorporating additional machine learning models for better accuracy.
